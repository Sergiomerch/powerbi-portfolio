Titanic Survivors – Power BI Analysis

This project analyzes real passenger data from the Titanic to practice Power BI, improve visualization skills, and explore the relationship between age, gender, social class, and survival outcomes.

Analysis Performed
1. Average Age

Calculated the average age of the passengers and explored how it varied between survivors and non-survivors.

2. Fare Comparison

Compared the average fare paid by men vs. women and analyzed whether ticket price had any relation to survival probability.

3. Survival by Gender

Created a visual comparison to identify whether more men or women survived.
Also reviewed the age distribution within each group.

4. Survival by Class (Pclass)

Analyzed how many men and women were in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd class, and how this influenced survival rates.
Included age segmentation to observe more detailed patterns.

Additional Data Not Analyzed

The dataset includes variables related to whether passengers were traveling alone or with family, such as:

SibSp: number of siblings/spouses aboard

Parch: number of parents/children aboard

These columns were not analyzed yet because I was unsure how to approach them, but they are part of my planned improvements.

Project Goals

Practice data modeling in Power BI

Develop clear and structured visualizations

Interpret basic statistics

Build a public analysis portfolio

Feedback

This is my first Power BI project as an enthusiast, and I would appreciate any feedback to continue improving.

Dataset

The original dataset comes from the Titanic competition on Kaggle.
